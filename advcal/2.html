            <h2>Two Horses on a Cosmic Adventure</h2>
        
        <div style=" text-align: justify; word-break: break-normal;">    <p>
            Trippy and Maverick were two horses who loved nothing more than spending time together. As they arrived at the beach, they could see the waves crashing against the shore. Trippy and Maverick were a little nervous, but they were also excited to try something new.
        </p><p>
            They waded into the water and began to paddle out on their boards. At first, the waves were small and easy to ride. Trippy and Maverick were having a great time.
        </p><p>
            But as the day went on, the waves began to get bigger and bigger. Trippy and Maverick were having trouble keeping their balance on their boards.
        </p><p>
            Suddenly, a huge wave appeared out of nowhere. Trippy and Maverick tried to ride it, but it was too big and powerful. The wave swept them up and carried them high into the sky.
        </p>
            Trippy and Maverick were flying through the air, hanging onto their boards for dear life. They didn't know what was happening, but they were having the time of their lives.
        </p>
            As they flew higher and higher, they realized that they were no longer on Earth. They had been carried into outer space by the wave, and were now hurtling through the stars.
        </p>
            Trippy and Maverick were scared, but also excited. They had never been to space before, and didn't know what they would find.
        </p><p> 
            As they flew, they saw many different planets and star systems. They saw colorful gas giants and swirling nebulas, and were mesmerized by the beauty of the universe.
        </p><p> 
            Eventually, they came across the Betelgeuse star system. They saw a large, red planet with swirling clouds and towering mountains. Trippy and Maverick knew that this was where they were meant to be.
        </p><p>  
            They landed on the planet and quickly realized that it was inhabited. They saw two strange creatures standing on the side of the road, holding a sign that said "Hitchhiking to the Center of the Universe."
        </p><p> 
            Trippy and Maverick were curious, so they approached the creatures and asked where they were going. The creatures, who turned out to be friendly aliens, told Trippy and Maverick that they were on a quest to find the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
        </p><p> 
            Trippy and Maverick were fascinated by this idea, and decided to join the aliens on their journey. They set off together, exploring the planet and learning about its inhabitants.
        </p><p> 
            As they traveled, they encountered many different creatures and learned about their cultures and beliefs. They saw amazing sights and experienced incredible things.
        </p><p> 
            But most importantly, they began to understand the true meaning of life, the universe, and everything. They realized that it was not something that could be found in one place, but was a journey that each individual must take for themselves.
        </p><p> 
            Trippy and Maverick were grateful to have met the hitchhiking aliens and to have embarked on this incredible adventure. They knew that they would always cherish their time with them, and would never forget the lessons they learned there.
