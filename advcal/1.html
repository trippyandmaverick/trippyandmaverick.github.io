  <h1>Trippy and Maverick</h1>
  <p>
    Trippy and Maverick, two horses so in love <br>
They trotted and galloped under skies above <br>
Together they went on adventures each day <br>
Their bond grew stronger in every way
  </p>
  <p>
    They took a holiday to the beach one day <br>
The warm sun on their backs, the breeze in their manes <br>
They galloped along the shore, so full of glee <br>
Exploring all that the beach had to see 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the water they played, in the sand they rolled <br>
So happy and carefree, their hearts full and bold <br>
As the sun began to set, they lay on the shore <br>
Watching the stars come out, wanting the day to be more 
  </p>
  <p>
    But eventually, they knew they must go <br>
Back to the stable, their home sweet and low <br>
But their memories of the beach, they would always keep <br>
A special holiday together, forever to sleep. 
  </p>
