            <h2>Trippy and Maverick's Adventures in the Betelgeuse Treasure Trove: Beyond the Collapse</h2>
        
        <div style=" text-align: justify; word-break: break-normal;">   <p>Trippy and Maverick were exploring the hidden treasure trove at the center of the planet in the Betelgeuse star system. They were amazed by the ancient artifacts they found there, and were learning more and more about the planet’s past.
        </p><p>            

            But as they were leaving the treasure trove, they heard a loud rumbling noise. The ground began to shake and Trippy and Maverick knew that they were in danger.
        </p><p>            
 
            They looked around frantically, trying to find a way out. But the treasure trove was collapsing all around them, and they could see that they were running out of time. Trippy and Maverick held hands tightly and ran as fast as they could. They dodged falling debris and jumped over cracks in the ground, their hearts pounding with fear.
        </p><p>            
  
            As they ran, they spotted a small opening in the wall. It looked like it might lead to a way out, but it was too small for them to fit through. Trippy and Maverick didn’t hesitate. They used their strong horse legs to kick and punch at the wall, widening the opening until they could squeeze through.

        <p>            
 
            They made it out of the treasure trove just in time, as the entire structure collapsed behind them. Trippy and Maverick were shaken and exhausted, but they were also relieved to be safe.
        </p><p>             
            They took a few moments to catch their breath, then set off to continue their adventure on the planet in the Betelgeuse star system. They knew that they had many more challenges and obstacles to overcome, but they were ready for anything.</p>
