            <h2>Daisy Dreams</h2>
        
        <div style=" text-align: justify; word-break: break-normal;">   <p>Trippy and Maverick were exploring the center of the planet in the Betelgeuse star system. They had found a hidden treasure trove of ancient artifacts, and were learning more and more about the planet's past.</p>
<p>
            But as they were exploring, Trippy realized that she was feeling hungry. She remembered that her favorite food was a three times whisked daisy smoothie, and she knew that she had to find a way to make one.
</p><p>            
            Trippy looked around and spotted a patch of daisy flowers growing nearby. She picked as many as she could and brought them back to where Maverick was.
        </p><p>            
            Trippy carefully washed the daisy flowers and placed them in a small bowl. She then took a whisk and began to blend the flowers into a smooth paste. She whisked the paste three times, making sure to get every last drop of flavor out of the daisy flowers.

        <div class="container-sm bg-light" style="opacity: 0.7;"><br>
            <div style=" text-align: justify; word-break: break-normal;">
        <p>            
            Once the daisy paste was smooth and creamy, Trippy poured it into a glass and added some water. She stirred the mixture well, then tasted it to make sure it was perfect.
        </p><p>        
            Trippy was thrilled with the result. The three times whisked daisy smoothie was exactly as she had hoped it would be: refreshing, delicious, and full of flavor. She shared it with Maverick, and they both enjoyed it immensely.
        </p><p>        
            As they drank their smoothies, Trippy and Maverick continued to explore the treasure trove, learning more and more about the planet's past and the secrets it held. They knew that they would have many more adventures on the planet in the Betelgeuse star system, and they were excited for what was to come.
