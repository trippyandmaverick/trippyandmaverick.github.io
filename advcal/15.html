        <div style=" text-align: left"> <p><b>Trippy:</b> "Howdy Maverick, we made it to that Western pub we've been wantin' to check out!"</p>
          <p><b>Maverick:</b> "Yeah, and it looks like the Wise Old Dragon is already here, sittin' at the bar with a cold brewsky. How's it going, Wise Old Dragon?"</p>
          <p><b>Wise Old Dragon:</b> "I'm doin' just fine, Maverick. It's nice to see you two again. I hear you've been on quite the adventure since we last met."</p>
          <p><b>Trippy:</b> "We sure have. Thanks to you, we were able to put out that fire and save the planet at Betelgeuse. We were starting to lose hope, but you showed us the power of regeneration and helped bring the planet back to life. We're forever grateful for your help."</p>
          <p><b>Wise Old Dragon:</b> "I'm glad I could help. It's a dragon's duty to protect the planets and their inhabitants. But you two need to be more careful in the future. That fire could have destroyed the entire planet and all its inhabitants. You don't want to be known as the horses who burnt down Betelgeuse."</p>
          <p><b>Maverick:</b> "Speakin' of duties, I think it's my duty to order another round of beers for the table. We deserve a cold one after all we've been through. It's been a real horse of a journey."</p>
          <p><b>Trippy:</b> "Yeah, I'll join ya. And I think I'll order a daisy beer while I'm at it. It's a real flower power drink. Plus, it'll help cool down the flames from that fire on Betelgeuse. We don't want to get too heated up again."</p>
          <p><b>Bartender:</b> "Coming right up, folks. And might I suggest the vegan daisy burger to go along with those beers. It's a real herd-pleaser."</p>
          <p><b>Trippy:</b> "That sounds great, thanks! We'll definitely give it a try."</p>
          <p><b>Wise Old Dragon:</b> "Indeed you have. But remember, with great adventure comes great responsibility. Don't let your curiosity get the best of you again. You don't want to be known as the horses who burnt down another planet. And always be prepared for the consequences of your actions. You don't want to end up as a horse-fallen hero."</p>
          <p><b>Maverick:</b> "Don't worry, we've learned our lesson. We'll be more careful from now on. We don't want to be horse criminals. We'll make sure to think before we act, and make sure we don't cause any more destruction in the galaxy."</p>
          <p><b>Trippy:</b> "Here's to a new beginnin' and more pun-derful adventures in the galaxy! And to never starting a fire on a planet again. We'll make sure to explore the galaxy responsibly and help protect the planets and their inhabitants."</p>
